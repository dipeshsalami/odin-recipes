# odin-recipes
This is my first project in TOP. My task is to
make a recipe website.
"The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."
This project upon completion will show what I have learned in HTML. My website shall contain headings, diff paragraphs, bold and italic texts, images and link linking to other webpages.
completed my recipe task from TOP. Having some issues uploading to github.
